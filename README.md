# Maven & Gradle Training
Training examples for the most commons usages of Maven and Gradle in Java Projects

# Description
Maven & Gradle manage the dependencies and the building of Java projects.
Both tools rely on the same default convention of project's directory structure:


```
└───project-home-dir
    ├───pom.xml
    ├───build.gradle (in the case of Gradle)
    ├───settings.gradle (in the case of Gradle) 
    └───src
        ├───main
        │   ├───java
        │   └───resources
        └───test
            ├───java
            └───resources        
 ```
